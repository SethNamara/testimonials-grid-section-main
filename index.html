                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                    " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experince here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at a VR startup. "

                    " Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of thiers who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire cirriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, In particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutoirial could ever have. In  fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
